### [Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/)

<p align="justify">
<b>Description</b>: The SNLI corpus (version 1.0) is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs manually labeled for 
balanced classification with the labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral, supporting the task of natural language inference
(NLI), also known as recognizing textual entailment (RTE).
<p align="justify">
  
<p align="justify">
The original data set contains <b>570,152</b> sentence pairs, each labeled with one of the following relationships: entailment, 
contradiction, neutral and –, where – indicates a lack of consensus from the human annotators. Discarding the sentence pairs labeled 
with – and keeping the remaining ones results in <b>549,367</b> pairs for training, <b>9,842</b> pairs for development and 
<b>9,824</b> pairs for testing.

### [Multi-Genre NLI Corpus, or MultiNLI](https://repeval2017.github.io/shared/)

<p align="justify">
The task dataset (called the Multi-Genre NLI Corpus, or MultiNLI) consist of 393k training examples drawn from five genres of text, and 40k test and development examples drawn from those same five genres, as well as five more. Data collection for the task dataset is closely modeled as SNLI.

### [Quora Question Pairs](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs)

<p align="justify">
Description: Quora question dataset consists of over 400,000 lines of potential question duplicate pairs. Each line contains IDs for each question in the pair, the full text for each question, and a binary value that indicates whether the line truly contains a duplicate pair. Here are a few sample lines of the dataset:
